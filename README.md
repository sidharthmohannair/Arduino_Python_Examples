# Arduino-Python Serial Communication Examples

This repository contains examples of how to use Python to communicate with Arduino via serial communication. Each example demonstrates a different aspect of Arduino control using a Python script. Whether you're a beginner or looking to expand your skills, these tutorials provide a hands-on approach to learning.

## Examples

1. **[Single LED Control](/1_Single_LED_Control/Single_LED_Control_README.md)**
   - Control a single LED using a Python script.
   - **Arduino Code:** `single_led_control.ino`
   - **Python Script:** `com_single_led.py`
   - **Description:** Demonstrates basic serial communication for turning an LED on and off.

2. **[Multiple LEDs Control](/2_Multiple_LEDs_Control/multiple_LEDs_Control_README.md)**
   - Control multiple LEDs using a Python script.
   - **Arduino Code:** `multiple_leds_control.ino`
   - **Python Script:** `com_multiple_leds.py`
   - **Description:** Shows how to send commands to control multiple LEDs.
